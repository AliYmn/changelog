# Changelogs Generator
Hey! This Package is a [changelogs-cli](https://pypi.org/project/changelogs-cli/)  package that creates automatic changelogs that supports [Conventional Commits.](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
Since we use Bitbucket, we needed something like this and I wanted to share it publicly in case you need it too.

# Emoji Support
If comments comply with conventional commit rules, they are supported with emoji.
